This code is partly written in Matlab and partly in Python.
The folder *Main analyses* contains the scripts that can reproduce all results reported in the manuscript. 
All supporting functions are in the *Helper files* folder. 

External toolboxes that are used are:
* The Brain Connectivity Toolbox (version 2015_01_25)
* SPM12
* The Donders Machine Learning Toolbox
